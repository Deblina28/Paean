Optical Heart Monitoring System

## Inspiration
We all saw how everyone started go panic during the onset of pandemic and it was because of the lack of solid information and the spread of fake news. And this is how people fall under the misconception and get confused about the symptoms of a disease. That is why we wanted to build a project that will allow people to check whether they are COVID positive or not. Also, we didn't want our project to only be limited to a COVID test, but instead we wanted to make a monitoring device that will come in handy even when (or if) the pandemic ends.
